        <h1>Understanding and Managing Headaches</h1>
        <p><em>A comprehensive guide to different types of headaches and how to find relief.</em></p>

        <h2>Types of Headaches</h2>
        <p>Headaches are one of the most common medical complaints. While most are not serious, they can be debilitating. Understanding the type of headache you have is the first step toward effective treatment.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Tension-Type Headaches</h3>
        <p>This is the most common type of headache. It often feels like a constant ache or pressure around the head, especially at the temples or back of the head and neck.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Dull, aching head pain; sensation of tightness or pressure across the forehead or on the sides and back of the head.</li>
            <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> Stress, poor posture, fatigue, eye strain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Migraine Headaches</h3>
        <p>Migraines are intense, throbbing headaches, often on one side of the head. They can be accompanied by other symptoms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Pulsating pain, nausea, vomiting, extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Some people experience an "aura" before the headache, which can include visual disturbances.</li>
            <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> Hormonal changes, certain foods and drinks, stress, and changes in sleep patterns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Cluster Headaches</h3>
        <p>Cluster headaches are severe, recurring headaches that are more common in men. They occur in cyclical patterns or cluster periods.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Excruciating, stabbing pain on one side of the head, often around the eye. Other symptoms include a runny nose, eye-watering, and restlessness.</li>
            <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> Alcohol and smoking can trigger attacks during a cluster period.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
        <p>While most headaches can be managed with over-the-counter medication and lifestyle changes, some require medical attention. Seek immediate help if your headache:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is sudden and severe (a "thunderclap" headache).</li>
            <li>Is accompanied by fever, stiff neck, confusion, seizure, double vision, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking.</li>
            <li>Follows a head injury.</li>
            <li>Gets worse over time and changes in pattern.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Management and Prevention</h2>
        <p>Managing headaches often involves a combination of medication and lifestyle adjustments.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or paracetamol can be effective for tension headaches. Migraines and cluster headaches often require prescription medication.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure regular sleep.</li>
                    <li>Stay hydrated.</li>
                    <li>Eat regular meals.</li>
                    <li>Manage stress through techniques like yoga, meditation, or exercise.</li>
                    <li>Limit caffeine and alcohol intake.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
